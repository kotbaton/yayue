# The following two specs are necessary.   ------------------------------------------
# Therefore, the (given as example) values of each of the two below specified
# yaml/dict keys (model_id, crit_def) should be replaced by the values appropriate
# for each analysis.

# root-name of the core/substantive model instance; the corresponding *dll file
# has to be provided in the Models dir
model_id: jg1

# criteria definition
# each sub-list defines one criterion: [crit_name, type (max or min), core-model var.]
crit_def: [ [q1, max, x1], [q2, max, x2], [q3, max, x3] ]


# The following specs are optional.  --------------------------------------------
# If the option is desired, then uncomment the line with {key: value} pair and
# modify the value

# Directories. Each dir-name needs for finish with the / char          -----------
# Dir with models; each model prepared by dill, using extension dll (eg., jg1.dll)
# modDir: Models/

# Sub-directory of the corresponding ana_dir containing results (df's and plots)
# resDir: Results/

# core-model variables values of which shall be included in the report
# rep_vars: ['cost', 'invT', 'carb', 'oilImp', 'capTot', 'actS']

# A sub-directory of the resDir for results of the corresponding execution run.
# Note: many subdirectories can be defined to organize outcomes of diverse runs.
# run_id: large0/

# file-names          -----------
# To redirect the stdout (e.g., of a long run) define the corresponding file name
# (the option identified by the key: fn_out) 
# fn_out: stdOut.txt

# Control options     -----------

# max number of iterations
# mxIter: 16

# parRep: True for generating Pareto representation, False for predefined preferences
# parRep: True

# verbosity level (controls print detail-level) [0, 3]
# verb: 0

# set to either True or False to show/no-show plots
# showPlot: True
